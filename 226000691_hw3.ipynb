    "# Part 0: Yelp review data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, given a Yelp review, your task is to implement two classifiers to predict if the business category of this review is \"food-relevant\" or not, **only based on the review text**. The data is from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to download this data file as your training data: [training_data.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_13wIEAmbQMdzBVTndwenoxQlk) \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data file includes 40,000 Yelp reviews. Each line is a json-encoded review, and **you should only focus on the \"text\" field**. As same as in homework 1, you should tokenize the review text by using the regular expression \"\\W+\" (we discussed it in [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/ixkk1fy863r1vs?cid=29). Do NOT remove stop words. **Do casefolding but no stemming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The label (class) information of each review is in the \"label\" field. It is **either \"Food-relevant\" or \"Food-irrelevant\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing data\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide 100 yelp reviews here: [testing_data.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_13wIEAmbQMbXdyTkhrZDN4Wms). The testing data file has the same format as the training data file. Again, you can get the label informaiton in the \"label\" field. Only use it when you evalute your classifiers."

    "In this part, you will implement a Naive Bayes classifier, which outputs the probabilities that a given review belongs to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a mixture model that mixes the probability from the document with the general collection frequency of the word. **You should use lambda = 0.7**. Be careful about the decimal rounding since multiplying many probabilities can generate a tiny value. We will not grade on the exact probability value, so feel free to change to logorithm summation (it's not required, though). If the tie case happens, **always go to the \"Food-irrelevant\" side**.\n",

    "### What to report\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the entire testing dataset, report the overall accuracy.\n",
