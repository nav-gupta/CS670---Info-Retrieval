    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will get first hand experience building a text-based mini search engine. In particular, there are three main learning objectives: (i) the basics of tokenization (e.g. stemming, case-folding, etc.) and its effect on information retrieval; (ii) basics of index building and Boolean retrieval; and (iii) basics of the Vector Space model and ranked retrieval.\n",

    "*Submission Instructions:* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as lastname_firstinitial_hw#.ipynb. For example, my homework submission would be: caverlee_j_hw1.ipynb. Submit this notebook via ecampus. Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. \n",

    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use up to three of your late days, meaning that no submissions will be accepted after Friday, February 5 at 11:59pm."
